What a great Filmmaker is Atleee he is massiest director for today genzzz in whole Indian Cinema but didn't have Thalapathy cameo it's ok but we got such another superstar cameo not only but his controversy also when you will watch the movie you will get everything. storyline is really good and impactful message to the whole government of our country is really needed. Storyline of every Girls in jawan is really emotional flashback and they did such excellent job in the performance by Shah Rukh Khan in dual role as Vikram Rathore and Azad was really fantastic and mind blowing where you will forget who is Vikram or Azaad he did such great and craziest job in the movie and his entry is really goosebumps with such different looks and Music of Anirudh especially Vikram Rathore entry üíØüíØ performance by Nayantara is really amazing and she looked so attractive and beautiful in the movie, Deepika Padukone cameo was really good and she will also make you emotional, performance by Sanya Malhotra, lehar khan and Priyamani and their flashback story was really emotional and their performance was really brilliant. Performance by one and only villanious Makkal Selvan Vijay sethupathi was really crazy and hell in the movie especially whenever he comes to screen he ates it. Performance by Ridhi Dogra, Girija Oak , Aliyah Qureshi, Sunil Grover was really good, eijaz Khan , Jaffer Sadiq and Sanjeeta bhattacharya was really great in their roles. Music by Anirudh is second lead Hero of Jawan and Cinemathography and direction was really fantastic in the movie and please take your family with you and watch this movie they will surely enjoy it and please don't miss the beginning please it's goosebumps entry with such top notch Visuals and Music üî•üî•üò±ü§Øüòçü§åüíØ.

8.0,5.0,"'Jawaan' is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets. It's action-packed, visually stunning, and emotionally resonant. So, grab your popcorn, your sense of humor, and your thinking cap, because this movie is a wild ride you won't want to miss. SRK, take a bow, you've delivered a blockbuster that's both brainy and brawny!"
9.0,4.0,"Shahrukh Khan plays a mystery stranger in a remote northeast village as the film opens with a bang. JiVikram Rathore (Shah Rukh Khan), a charismatic soldier, decides to assist society in an unusual way. He commandeers a metro train, takes the passengers hostage, and demands something of Khaali Gaikwad (Vijay Sethupathi). The remainder of the film is devoted to Shahrukh Khan and Shahrukh Khan fighting against crony capitalism, substandard loans, farmer suicides, underfunded public hospitals, subpar military equipment, and immoral politicians. This is the subject of the movie."
10.0,4.0,"Jawan is a stylish action movie with enough plot twists and turns to keep spectators interested. Jawan is incredibly entertaining and always interesting.  It's a stylish, polished, action-packed movie with a compelling plot, thrills, and patriotism. After Pathan's enormous success, Shahrukh Khan has once more come back with a bang, delighting his admirers."

12.0,4.0,"""Jawan"" is a gripping Indian film that takes viewers on an emotional rollercoaster ride through the life of a soldier committed to protecting his country at all costs. Directed by BVS Ravi and starring Sai Dharam Tej in the lead role, this movie delivers a powerful message about duty, sacrifice, and the true meaning of being a patriot."
13.0,5.0,"...climax was something that one can truly call  an ""Art"" ... masterpiece of a film ...have seen so many so called Mass pictures but #jawan is something different , it hits differently ,  it has all elements that a mass picture should have everything here is upto logic and yes it was truly for the masses that is the ""People of India"" where it did talk about a lot of social issues which ofcourse our media don't has guts to cover ...and reminded all of us Indian Citizens of the power unique to us ..what is it .?..for that go and watch movie.....the film has everything to offer.... to  everyone be it witty situational comedy or serious intense scenes or romance..well ofcourse its shahrukh khan after all ...and the best thing is that it connects to the emotions of common folks like us and our problems ....."
14.0,4.0,Shahrukh Khan has proved once again that if you know your craft well you can literally handle the entire movie on your shoulders alone. This man has achieved stardom with years of hardwork and dedication. He literally has this Superstar presence and it honestly did make me and other people extremely happy especially with his opening sequence. He literally does use his emotions to his advantage and that connects well with his audience. Jawan definitely gave me an outstanding experience especially the 1st half of the movie is mindblowing. Couldn't point out a single mistake. The long shots were mesmerizing. 2nd half was not as sharp as the 1st one but I'm sure this actor will definitely pick up his 9th Filmfare Award soon and create history again.
15.0,5.0,"I've only 5 stars & even more if it has so, for this film. If I say, this would be 2nd Biggest Movie of SRK's career after DDLJ which has sure-shot possibility to run for more than 30 yrs in theatres, if the theatres wish to run it only then. This movie needs to have a full-fledged ""THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE"" & u will get to see how Shah Rukh Sir evolved throughout the movie with his six different looks, double roles. VFX, Cinematography and the songs are all Top Notch & Looks very promising as matching as the level of a biggie Hollywood movie. That's why Red Chillies VFX is still now OG in Bollywood industry. Talking about movie, it had intense and strong plot which would keep u glued to ur seats and will make u cry, laugh and break down during some strong portrayals. Overall, its a Must Must Watch and one shouldn't watch it by piracy, just go to the theatres & experience the Cinematic Experience that u haven't yet experienced. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòçüßø‚ù§Ô∏è"
16.0,1.0,"‚ÄòJawan‚Äô is a terribly made film about a group of vigilantes who hold the government to ransom and then surprisingly make it do good deeds. All this is just re-treaded territory, first ignited by visionary mass director S. Shankar, and now Atlee, his former assistant director, who does his usual lazy shtick by simply rehashing the old stuff with overboiled, done-to-death, screamingly melodramatic direction ‚Äì I badly wanted to exit the theatre at the 1.5 hour mark but forced myself to finish the nearly 3 hour punishment. "
17.0,1.0,"The entire movie is quite a spectacle but before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections a political message has been delivered across the country in a unique and very clever way.  First, mass suicide of farmers in states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Punjab and other states ~ secondly, death of childrens in Uttar Pradesh due to lack of oxygen cylinders during Covid ~ thirdly, Nirab Modi Mehul Chowksi fled abroad after taking a loan from the bank ~ finally King khan himself delivered the Dialogue ""If someone comes to your house to ask for votes by dividing the country in the name of religion, show them your hand"" ~ Do you understand the attempt to send a message to the society through the movie ?  Even Vijay Sethupathi, the villain of the film, has been shown as a CORRUPTED BUSINESSMEN and an attempt has been made to compare him with whom?  Yes, Gautam Adani is right."
18.0,1.0,"It is painful to see storied superstar Shah Rukh Khan degenerating so badly in the later decades of his career. This artiste who toplined such excellent movies as DDLJ, Dil Se, Devdas, Asoka, Swades has stopped caring about quality from a long time and only lusts after more box office triumphs no matter how shoddy his recent films are. Notice he has long since stopped working with good directors and the few good ones he has recently worked with have been compromised by poor collaboration (Imtiaz Ali ‚Äì ‚ÄòJab Harry Met Sejal‚Äô). "
19.0,1.0,"I aged 5 years watching jawan! This was my first reaction stepping out of the theater. An implausible, wafer thin plot peppered with jingoistic punchlines, cartwheeling cars, over the top villains and‚Ä¶SRK in not one but a double role. It‚Äôs  excruciatingly painful to watch and can put a root canal to shame. Perhaps the only redeeming part of this over the top mad caper is the character of the villain played by Vijay Sethupathi who exudes enough menace but strangely goes by the Maharashtrian name of Gaikwad (wink, wink) while spouting lines with a characteristic tamilian twang. The huge plot holes and glitches don‚Äôt end there. A collector who goes by the name of Menon is killed and he gets a church service. (lazy research, I think). The scene in which he gets killed seeks inspiration from the blue pill/ red pill scene from Matrix. All similarities end there sadly. "
20.0,1.0,"Pathetic ..crass movie‚Ä¶Though good social messages but not very well handled. Antagonist is more like a clown or Santa Claus. Totally a waste of time and hard earned, hardly earned money. Be careful, chatbots and paid media are promoting this film big time. The protagonist has  been shown smoking cigars while doing acrobats, in a way glorifying smoking. Being a die hard SRK fan, went to watch only to come out regretting. Vijay Sethupathy is a waste, a good fit only for South Indian movies.His Hindi dialogue delivery soooo bad..Hindi movies should not be made in South Indian style or flavour, looks so cheap and laughable. Hindi film industry copying south is a making fun of each other‚Äôs culture. Atlee please do not make anymore movies in Hindi. Only Rajnikanth can deliver in Hindi cinemas and not every south actor is Rajnikanth. Deepika looks beautiful, as we could connect to her character and her pain. Rest of the cast, I am sure none of the audience will be able to connect as there is no background provided for them except for two ladies- the farmers daughter turned vigilante and the lady doctor who was wrongly framed for not procuring enough oxygen cylinders resulting in many deaths. It is a total SRK show. He is always present on side of the screen with his magnetic presence and chiseled body. Story lacks depth, we have seen many times in the past. Villain is not at all formidable, even a fat podgy police constable can beat him to death. Though pre interval fight sequence of senior SRK was commendable, but still thinking where did he get to know about the younger srk and Nayanthara being held captive by kaali‚Äôs younger brother?? Did that young boy who grew up to find senior SRK‚Äôs identity tell him.. totally a senseless sequence.Anyways though the movie has collected its Moolah, it is really not worth wasting time watching this trashy movie.let‚Äôs see if SRK‚Äôs social message will change the government next year, which is highly doubtful. If it does than SRK is surely bigger than Modi, who in himself is a bigger than any superstar as he is a true statesman and more popular person(leader) in the world than SRK.Moreover, public memory is very short lived, will forget everything with the next blockbuster on the anvil.. Tiger3. They should have released this movie next year before elections to see a real impact, if any, it had on the audience. Above all, love you SRK, you are the BEST.. and we wait for you PATHAN but not for this JAWAN.. Even title of the movie is misleading ‚Ä¶ It should be Beimaan for cheating audience .."
21.0,2.0,"Being a South Indian, atlee's jawan did not bring anything new to the platter except for the excitement to see shahrukh doing what rajnikant, vikram, kamala hassan, vijay did from last 10 years. Current social issues are raised, and our superhero tackles it with applause from the public in the movie and audience out of the movie. "
22.0,2.0,"It‚Äôs like a rajnikanth or 80s amitabh movie formula applied on srk. They had a script for the first 30-40 minutes, which sho+F25t just became like a series of random elements - 30 action scenes, 3 songs, 20 minutes of deepika, ridiculous addition of sanju baba, all just somehow put together with a purely decorative villain (wasting so many good actors!). The film has no engaging storyline, no suspense, no climax. At no point after the first sequence, I empathized with the characters, or felt that any of them were in any danger, such is the kind of storytelling. The social messages lost their impact being surrounded by such ridiculous sequences. However, Jawan has more content than Pathan, in case you were wondering. Sigh, being an srk fan has become such a torture these days! Movies like these make you value the earlier srk school of movies with good romantic plot with powerful underlying messages and substantial female roles even more! Last but not the least, I will remember the action scene where three eggs were thrown on the windscreen for a long time, because of its sheer comic randomness."
23.0,2.0,"Watched Jawaan with my family. I love all the lead actors SRK, Deepika Padukone, Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi. SRK acting especially the dad‚Äôs flashback is good. His portions with Deepika is good. Deepika‚Äôs acting & her portrayal is probably the only thing one would remember at the end. You feel for that character. No other character you will recall or remember because they come by so fast. The girls team idea is great but you don‚Äôt feel for any of them like in Dangal for example. Every frame has so much happening with so many people & at times it‚Äôs overwhelming. Nayantharas police character started off great, but fizzled out badly. Every time Jawaan team in the movie were successful you know they use high tech methods. But it‚Äôs so fast paced & confusing how they did it!! Music is good. Villan was like a joke. If only they had focused on the characters & screen play, with great actors like this cast, it could have been a superb movie. And this excess preaching needs to stop."
24.0,2.0,Oh my god!! I am a super fan of SRK. Only reason I dragged my family to watch it. I already knew that it‚Äôs a template movie and my expectations were low. Such lazy writing. SRK has given his heart and soul and we can see it so well. Nayanthara and Deepika did a great job as well. Rest of the cast were wasted. I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs just me or everyone felt that they have seen this movie in parts already. Good thing I love SRK. At least I could enjoy watching him. Message in the end albeit good has been conveyed over and over in so many movies. At some point we started a game figuring which other movie we have seen this particular plot/scene. I hope majority people start voting to avoid a repeat of similar concept movie.
25.0,2.0,Remix of south indian movies with bad acting by a few. Actors like Deepika could have learned from Nayanthara on how to act better. Bits and pieces of good music here and there but overall a disaster. Direction not at its best. Saving the grace is great cinematography and vfx. Stunts are superbly directed though the actors don‚Äôt do justice to choreography or stunt efforts. Locations are awesome but faces in front of them don‚Äôt justify the money spent. This could have been a good movie but cane out so wrong. Some people are better doing father roles instead of becoming heroes at this age when it reflects in the face above all the makeup.
26.0,2.0,Giving this two stars only because of Shahrukh Khan. You can surely go to watch this movie to see superb fitness and typical styles of the superstar. Director tried to make it a south Indian movie..... movie has some good messages for social awakening. Co-stars have worked well. Songs were not required in this movie and they were not catchy. Only one song you will like and that is Bekarar karke hame yu na jaiye.... so final words ...you can surely go to watch this movie for just some fun.
27.0,3.0,"In the emerging efforts of uniting Indian cinema, ""Jawan,"" the latest cinematic endeavor graced by the presence of the unparalleled Shah Rukh Khan, emerges as a tantalizing dichotomy of potential and mediocrity. With the cautious optimism of an intrigued cinephile, I ventured into this cinematic narrative, hopeful of witnessing a transformative and paradigm-shifting opus from the Badshah of Bollywood. However, it is with a heart heavy with the weight of unmet expectations that I commit my thoughts to this critique, echoing the sentiment of a conscientious observer."
28.0,3.0,"In summation, ""Jawan"" stands as a cinematic journey marked by the tension between promise and compromise. The first act tantalizes with its innovative aspirations, while the second act succumbs to the gravitational pull of Bollywood's conventions. Shah Rukh Khan's luminous presence remains the film's beating heart, a testimony to his indomitable charisma. As I reflect upon this narrative, I bestow upon it a rating of 3.5 out of 5."
29.0,3.0,"Decent entertaining movie.There were no lags in the entire film but each and every scene was a mix of previous movies with a little different style given here.Seeing Srk as a mass hero was a new positive thing and his screen presence and mass dialogue and action lit the screens‚ù£.All the girls Priyamani,Sanya and other 4 performed well to their given characters."
30.0,3.0,"I loved this SRK‚Äôs gem of work. It‚Äôs definitely awesome. Full paisa wasool movie. I would‚Äôve given 5star but didn‚Äôt because Nayantara screen timing and her role wasn‚Äôt upto the mark. She has so much potential to act badass cop. Right attitude, aura, body language, face and she know how to control her emotion. Deepika‚Äôs screentime was so much unnecessarily included infact her act was lengthy as hell. You showed 5 women as SRKs teammates but only 3 stories were depicted rest two stories weren‚Äôt shown. Disappointment there. Shahrukh no doubt justified both his roles especially father‚Äôs damn!!! Vijay setupathy was okay expected more villainous actions from him. I wished to watch Nayantara and SRk more. They had magical chemistry no doubt."
31.0,3.0,"Sound and fury. Good spectacle too with SRK looking like a living mummy and Hollywood type settings as well as thrills. A few contemporary issues like farmer suicides, hospital mismanagement and political corruption are satirised effectively.  The plot is too neat to be credible, however. Deus ex machina doesn't fail to appear at the right time. Light entertainment. Don't need brains to enjoy it. But the government deserves this, no doubt. ""Before questioning the son, ask the father"" is good dialogue especially coming from father SRK for the sake of son SRK."
32.0,3.0,"If you are a fan of SRK, watch it, Movie's storyline is so fast paced, It felt like the movie just want to end itself in the given time frame, Trust me if it was not for SRK this movie would have been ended as a disaster with any other main lead. Watched Pathaan FDFS, there was certain grip towards storyline which holds the audience . However, this movie should have been released before Pathaan. My review doesn't matter the most but just for SRK I gave 3 star. The story don't even deserve 2 star. I am not gona lie the guy next to me was litrally snoring. Waiting for Dunki"
33.0,3.0,Good in parts. But also boring in many. It‚Äôs far from a masterpiece.  It‚Äôs a typical bloated south movie with SRK instead of Rajni.  Stared off well and I thought I was going to be different. It coves some important topics and seemed like a very interesting premise.  But once the action started it just kept repeating every 10 minutes.  The plot just became a secondary item. Every scene was to just show SRK as a super star.    What a waste of Vijay S.  could have used some good intelligent dialogue.  Songs are not outstanding rather at best above average.  A sign of a great movie is if you can watch it again without hesitation. I would struggle to watch this one again.  If you are a SRK fan you likely will love it. I was waiting for it to be over
34.0,3.0,"Loved the way the review in The Hindu summed it up. One Nation. One Emotion. One SRK. Besides that one powerful message which we all know the movie has, and taking on the system, I saw the red and the blue pill, saw the Joker, saw Bane, saw Charlie‚Äôs Angels, saw Money Heist, saw Wolverine, and ‚Ä¶ At 2 hours and 50 mins, the film‚Äôs a tad long, a very South Indian one üòÑ, Nayanthara has superb screen presence (sigh), of all the songs, only one stands out, and there‚Äôs double the fun with SRK! I‚Äôll give it a 3.5 / 5. Definitely watch it if you are a SRK fan. ‚ù§Ô∏è."
35.0,3.0,"The plot of the  film is interesting but poorly represented, some of the sequences have no logic. This film asks some relevant questions of contemporary times but in an exaggerated manner which makes it a nonsense film. The director, Attlee, is the script writer too. Why was he in such a hurry to make such cocktails that taste so bad? God knows ! It is  a southern flavoured bollywood masala movie, copied from 3 to 4 different movies. None of the songs are good, you can't even listen to them a second time. Only people made it successful because of SRK. Maybe people are  frustrated with the present government/s and their policies, they are virtually protesting the system at the theatre."
36.0,3.0,"I cant say its a much watch, a good time pass yes!! All the hype of this movie made me so excited and it didnt live out to its hype unfortunately. First half was good had a story the second half was disappointing twin father and son :s its like i knew 90s movie all over again. As a lover or srk the different looks of him in the movie makes it interesting though. Over all i would it 3 out 5."
37.0,3.0,"I never really liked SRK's movie. Same old story with overacting but this one is a good one by ATLEE. Even though the finishing is a bit boring, the build-up was great. Lost plot and suspense in the mid part, it wd've been great if all the girl's story was played out. SRK overacting in some scenes as usual. Pathan was below par but jawan was better. Still, I think it should have been a 2part movie. Sethupathi should have more screen time. was expecting a bit of Kaali's origin and rise and his business enemies and that man with iron mask should have played a role in Kaali's life. Clean-shaved SRK was disastrous. i don't know what atlee was thinking here. but overall 3/5 for me."
38.0,3.0,"Jawan can be called a good action film which could in turn make it a blockbuster as well, but this movie gives us minute hints and glimpses of Nayak, Aparichit, I, Vikram, Jailer, and many more South Indian movies' stories poured in one script. Also, Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves level actions are attempted, but in vain. A fine Social Message ends up as Dramedy mocking the antagonist and public in common. However, a massy movie with SRK brand can bring the audience with an ordinary taste of average cinema."
39.0,4.0,"The theatre was packed for the 6 a.m. show at Keshari BBS! Jawan is a mass film with a relevant story, and SRK shines all the way with his charm, massy look, and, of course, with Cigar. But Vijay Sethupathi is the real showrunner here. His villainous act is charming and cunning. Nayanthara makes a great debut here. OMG! She is so beautiful. But the heart of the film is our Jawan girls. Atlee is showing us why he is the best on the market. The way he presented this film to us is mind-blowing and breathtaking. And Anirudh's score is like adrenaline. The best thing about Jawan is its cinematography. Each and every frame is beautiful. A little fast-paced, but that's understandable as Jawan is an action film. The ending was a little rushed, but I think it was me who wanted more. Jawan is by far the MASSIEST film BW has ever produced. A special mention goes to the stories of those girls. Emotions peaked in those parts. JAWAN‚ù§Ô∏è"
40.0,4.0,"Overall an entertaining flick from start to end! The first half had me hooked from the script to acting to direction, 2nd half diverted some of its focus from complex storytelling to crowd-pleasing action sequences and fast-paced exposition scenes though they were good I started losing interest in the story. Still, the movie delivers some great action scenes which you could tell had a great deal of thought and effort behind it. We get to see some great fight choreography as well but hated the fast-paced multiple-camera cuts within a few seconds. The soundtrack was okay. "
41.0,4.0,"Explosive and heart-pounding, Jawan delivers an adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster from start to finish. The choreographed stunts and jaw-dropping special effects are a visual feast for action enthusiasts. The Sharukh's charismatic performance keeps you invested in the high-stakes mission, while Vijay Sethupati adds a menacing edge. The relentless pace rarely lets up, with intense chases, relentless gunfights, and breathtaking set pieces that push the boundaries of believability. While character development takes a back seat to the action, it's forgivable given the genre's focus. Overall, if you crave non-stop thrills and spectacular sequences, this action-packed spectacle is a must-see."
42.0,4.0,"This movie is the true SRK comeback. Pathaan doesn't even reach close to it. Its got comedy, entertaining action sequences, great acting, a decent storyline and good music. The length of the movie doesn't feel dull and it passes by quickly meaning it's been a fun watch overall. The second half of the movie really picks up and leaves the audience with a smile at the end. The direction is superb and the style has many similarities to other successful South Indian action movies with similar context, this one just also happens to include SRK to cause a huge disruption - in a good way! The audience will be overall impressed and satisfied, this will definitely head towards becoming a blockbuster in bollywood and certainly breaking difficult box office records in quick succession! Great movie direction by Atlee. Rating - 4/5  üåüüåüüåüüåü"
43.0,4.0,"Jawan is really an excellent Masss entertaining movie with such stunning action scenes, Emotional scenes and amazing performance by every one, especially Shahrukh Khan, Nayatara, Vijay Sethupathi.  Mass entry for Srk with such stunning different looks storyline is really good and impactful message to the whole government of our country is really needed.  Deepika Padukone cameo was really good and she will also make you emotional, Anirudh music is outstanding, especially Vikram Rathore BGM.  Cinemathography and direction was really fantastic in the movie and please take your family with you and watch this movie they will surely enjoy it and please don't miss the beginning please it's goosebumps entry with such top notch Visuals and Music"
44.0,4.0,"Best Mass of movie of Bollywood in this decade. Jawan is a proper mass movie with heart-touching stories of different layers that are inspired by real-life malpractices in India. But at the same time, it gives you a roller-coaster ride experience with its high-octane action sequences. SRK as Vikram Rathore & Azad Rathore nailed it! Vijay Sethupati's locking horns with SRK was a bang!!! And, lady superstar Nayanthara was fascinating to watch on the big screen. From her dialogue delivering in Hindi to doing hand-to-hand action sequences, she notched up everything. Anirudh's electrifying BGM sent chills down my spine. The music was underwhelming nonetheless.  Above all, Jawan is a treat to your eyes to enjoy on the big screen."
45.0,4.0,"Jawan is a cinematic masala treat to every single audience.. ATLEE the south director has shown how a mass masala movie is made to Bollywood and he does it with a bang .. BGM by Anirudh is awesome .. Scintillating performance by every single one in the cast line .. SRK in a dual role steals the show, Nayantara looks good and delivers a killer performance which is well supported by Priyamani & all the other girl gang in the movie .. Vijay Sethupathi as villian did a good job.. Overall a Seeti Maar paisa Vasool movie .. One star less because Vijay Sethupathi is an amazing actor and his role could have been much more intense.. Enjoy the cinema in theatre and there is a strong message at the end which is well delivered by SRK.. Deepika and Sanjay Dutt in cameo is good .. ATLEE has a cameo in the first song .. Go out with your family to enjoy this cinematic treat called JAWAN and not to forget the interval block where u get introduced to 2 SRK which is electrifying .. üëçüëç"
46.0,4.0,"In one line, It's a Hindi speaking Tamil movie. The story line is too big for a common man. It felt like a Mersal, Kathi and Bigil to some extent in a larger Bollywood canvas. SRK‚Äôs performance was stellar and he proved to be the showman of mass masala action movies. His performance seems to be far better than Vijay in these kinda movies. Atlee makes no difference in emotions for Kollywood and Bollywood. The film showcases the problems in the area of agriculture, Medical, defence and give solutions in Atlee way. Overall for a person who used to watch Tamil movies, ‚ÄòJawan‚Äô is old wine bottled with new label and nothing fresh in content, and of course for a Bollywood and SRK lover it‚Äôs fresh as these kind of contents and makings are not seen much there and was executed well in its own way."
47.0,4.0,"Jawan is a political movie, the contemporary reality being narrated in a subtle way. The hospital scene reminded me of Dr Khafeel Khan and the child deaths in a hospital in UP and the current state of affairs, the death of soldiers to some incidents in Phulwama and elsewhere in which the govt. failed to provide the army helicopters (Satpal Malik issue). The farmer suicides issue has also been touched seriously, especially the high interest rate charged by banks compared to the easy interest rate policy towards corporates. The final scene is a direct message to voters - how they should address the elections and what questions they should ask to politicians. Political issues are very subtly handled, never giving the slightest doubt the present govt (govts) is criticised but if you read between the lines you can understand who is targeted. Overall a good entertainment with deep political undertones.'"
