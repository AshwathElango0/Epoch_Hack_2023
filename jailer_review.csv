0,5.0,"Rajani once again proved that he is the super star, with no replacement. His style, screen presence, swag. unbeatable."
1,5.0,"Rarely does a film come along that leaves an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape, and Rajinikanth's latest venture, ""The Jailer,"" does just that. From its compelling storyline to the powerhouse performances of the cast, this film stands as a testament to the enduring prowess of both the superstar and the art of filmmaking itself"
2,4.0," ''Jailer'' is a cinematic rollercoaster that demands to be experienced on the big screen. With Rajnikanth at the helm, the movie delivers on its promise of non-stop action while defying expectations by seamlessly transitioning into a heist narrative. "
3,3.0,"Though the character was needed, some of the detailing only increased the length of the movie. "
4,3.0,"Second half is purely Rajni's powerplay assuring many goosebump moments.But as one-liner, looks similar to the recent Vikram2 and another movie with violence that is the trend now. If you are so light hearted and can't tolerate for the other positives, then may not be the movie for you. Repeat mode for Rajni's fans, after his many recent films, in pure sense. Being a multiplex, it was all decent crowd."
5,3.0," Not a big fan of this director's style of narration / comedy, so no much amusement around any comedy sequence. Especially the track in Andhra during the smuggling scenes were simply extraneous, only helped in checking another state market in this attempted pan-India movie"
6,4.0,Jailer is not a usual thalaivar film but has every whistle moment of thalaivar and the aura of his presence is perfectly blended into the screenplay with amazing writing.
7,5.0,"I don't usually do movie reviews, but thought I'd share my thoughts. Because I was so very impressed and entertained by this movie. This delivers on the cost of the ticket and if you want to be entertained this is it. Nelson is back and no doubt about it. Rajinikanth after many years has got a role that he can perform and gets us invested in his character. "
8,3.0," All in all, it's a must-watch film, especially to witness Rajnikanth's character portrayal and a solid storyline."
9,5.0,TIGER ka Hukum !!TIGER ka Hukum !!
10,2.0,"Too much violence is shown in this old formula movie. Crushing the head with a hammer, decapitating using an axe with the head falling on the ground & torso standing errect with blood oozing out of the place where the head once stood, plucking of ear using a sickle, sulphuric acid baths giving blood curdling effect even without acid melting the human body being shown, people getting splashed with blood on their dress & many more such acts has given a new genre for the movie"
11,4.0,"Needless to say Thalaivar's presence alone enough to lit the screen , but as a bonus director Nelson gave us Thrilling & elevating action sequences blend with subtle dark humor "
12,1.0,"Reduced to star in such trash cinema!..and THAT is the real twist of this movie, and also maybe the fact that he got a 300cr. Cheque and the latest & best Merc model for this?..go figure!!!!"
13,5.0,Definitely a good movie after the previous miss hit..
14,1.0,Violence is too much and not likely to see too much of blood.
15,5.0,Rock solid performance by Super Star. The movie engages you very well 
16,2.0,though there are hard action sequences with blood which may look bad for a Rajini movie 
17,1.0,"this movie has shaken that belief. I sat through for a while, and then walked out. I could not watch it to completion for many reasons. For one, the violence and gore is a turn off. We have enough of it in real life, why make it part of a 2 hour fun as well. I cannot imagine being a character like the Jailer"
18,5.0,Good come back from Nelson ji. He has given every Rajni Elements in each & everytime required in the movie. 
19,4.0,"Hope blind, deaf and dumb Mallu directors/producers zero in on Vinayakan's performance value and cast him in movies where he can do justice to his immense talent."
20,5.0,"The film is an amazing come back by nelson, with the music by anirudh and rajni's out of the world acting sided together with an amazing plot and plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat the film is worth all the hype."
21,1.0,"I have been watching Rajni Sir's flim from my childhood. I have watched his 70s, 80s classics to annathe. Mostly Rajni sir's flims we can watch N number of times and still feel fresh. But this Jailer is mere pain. "
22,1.0,Movie felt completely baseless
23,2.0,I wasn't able to connect with any of the scenes. Music felt irrelevant at times

25,3.0,overall decent movie. homefully Superstar stick to have no younger age heroines like he did in this film.kudos team
26,2.0,"Too Much Fight Scenes , This Story Doesn't Need That Because Sometimes We Can't Stay Focused At The Story."
27,3.0,Not satisfied. 1 Or 2 Fight Scenes Are Enough For This Story Like Nelson Did It In His Previous Movie Doctor .
28,3.0,First half was good and interesting with powerfully Bgm's and Humour etc and usual Father - Son emotion and revenge...
29,3.0,"Second half was totally failed for me except climax bang of all three superstars of Kannada , Tamil and Malayalam."

36,4.0,Special mention the trio of superstars of three industries in the climax with Anirudh bgm ...pwoli pa..he elevated the whole vibe
37,5.0,"""Jailer"" is a gripping Tamil movie that captivates with its intense storytelling and strong character performances. The film skillfully weaves a tale of redemption as it follows the journey of a tough prison warden who undergoes a transformative change after encountering a wrongly accused inmate."
38,5.0,"Co - ( Big ) stars...in accompany our hero in the story even as a ""Cameo roles""  The best part which wows me is.."
39,5.0,"Starting from first frame, couldn't move my eyes away from the screen. Dark Humor at its core and Seeing Quirky Rajni makes me remember all his past extravaganza."
40,5.0,"Twists were really good and bursted out laughing many times. First half ?? & Second Half ??Overall Can't rate thalaivar film as a fan but 9/10 for Craft & 100000000/10 for Interval, Pre - Climax - Tharamana Sambavam ?? thalaivar dharisanam Climax - One of the very best in recent times."
